# Ultracapacitor Measurement and Control Board v2.0
1. fix the problem of interference signal transmission caused by wrong wiring in CAN bus differential communication is repaired
2. The overall device layout of the PCB board is optimized, making it more compact in size. At the same time, 
the position of some 0603 resistance capacitors is adjusted, making it easier to weld and change the XL1509-ADJ 
debugging resistance to change the DCDC step-down circuit
3. The wiring problems of some detection circuits have been repaired, and some errors of signal and voltage measurement have been solved
